A node.js server which provides a service for retrieving icons and other metadata associated with domains.

This is designed for use with the [passcards](https://github.com/robertknight/passcards)
password manager as a service that provides rich icons for domains.

This enables passcards to display prettier icons for items and may
in future other metadata about a site which a login is associated with.
